# The $HISTORY variable sets how many versions to keep.
# Set it to 0 to keep all versions.
#
# The $DB_TYPE variable can be set to either "mysql"
# or "pgsql". If it is "pgsql" you will be asked for the
# password via a prompt, since sending the password via
# CLI isn't allowed with the PostgreSQL database.
#
# Typically, you can leave the following variables blank,
# as they will be auto-populated based on the current user
# and the location of the project. You can fill them in
# for special cases for when you need to override the
# default settings:
#
# $TEST_SERVER
# $TEST_DEST
# $TEST_USER
# $LIVE_SERVER
# $LIVE_USER
#
# If you leave both servers blank, the assumption is
# made that both your test and live environments are on
# the current server, or localhost.
